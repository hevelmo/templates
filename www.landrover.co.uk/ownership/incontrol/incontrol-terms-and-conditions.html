The new terms may be displayed on-screen and you may be required to read and accept them to continue your use of the InControl Package.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Any such changes will be notified to you by e-mail.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>3.4Â Â  If you are a consumer, you may terminate your InControl Services in the event that any changes to these Terms or the InControl Package are to your material disadvantage. In such circumstances, if you are the first owner of your Vehicle, you must notify the authorised Land Rover dealer from whom you purchased or leased your Vehicle who will refund to you any amounts paid by you in advance for InControl Services that you have not yet received.Â </p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Â  Period during which we will provide the InControl ServicesÂ </strong></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>4.1Â Â  Once the set-up of your InControl Services account is complete we will send a confirmation e-mail to you to advise you that the InControl Services have commenced. Please note that the âSOS Emergency Callâ service will be active before set-up of your InControl Services account but on a limited non-personalised basis.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>4.2Â Â  The provision of InControl Services will end on the expiry date of your current subscription period (<strong>âEnd Dateâ</strong>) unless you choose to renew (as described in clause 4.3) beyond the End Date or the InControl Package is terminated earlier by either us or you in accordance with clauses 14 or 15. In the case of âSOS Emergency Callâ, âOptimised Land Rover Assistanceâ and âInControl Secureâ, the End Date is shown on the My Land Rover InControl website.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>4.3Â Â  You will be able to renew the InControl Services through the My Land Rover InControl website or by visiting one of our authorised Land Rover dealers. Information on how to renew your InControl Services will be made available on the My Land Rover InControl website.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>4.4Â Â  Please be aware that your access to and use of âSOS Emergency Callâ, âOptimised Land Rover Assistanceâ and âInControl Secureâ will end automatically if you remove your Vehicle from your InControl Services account.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>4.5Â Â  IF YOU NO LONGER OWN OR USE YOUR VEHICLE (FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU SELL THE VEHICLE, YOUR LEASE EXPIRES, OR THE VEHICLE IS LOST OR STOLEN AND NOT RECOVERED) YOU MUST REMOVE YOUR VEHICLE FROM YOUR INCONTROL SERVICES ACCOUNT. This can be done through My Land Rover InControl website. If you do not remove your Vehicle, you will remain responsible for all charges, if any, for any InControl Services incurred in connection with the Vehicle. It is your responsibility to remove all data and content (including any personal information), if any, that you may have stored on your Vehicle and the InControl Package before you sell or transfer your Vehicle, to the extent permitted by the equipment. You must also notify the new owner of the Vehicle if any services or features are active when you transfer the Vehicle, and you must make the new owner aware that those services or features involve the collection, use and sharing of data as described in these Terms and our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>5. Your personal information</strong>Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>5.1Â Â  The terms of our privacy policy as updated from time to time, available on the My Land Rover InControl website (<strong>âPrivacy Policyâ</strong>) form part of these Terms and apply to your use of the InControl Package. Please read it carefully.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>5.2Â Â  In order to provide you with the InControl Services it is necessary for us and our service providers to make use of location data sent from your Vehicle. We will always track the last parked location of the Vehicle (and such functionality cannot be switched off by you), however, you can turn off the journey tracking functionality (<strong>âJourneysâ</strong>) of the InControl Services at any time via the My Land Rover InControl website and the InControl Remote Smartphone App which will prevent any of the âJourney Informationâ (as defined in the Privacy Policy) from being sent from the Vehicle (except for the last parked location of the Vehicle). If, however, the âSOS Emergency Callâ, the âOptimised Land Rover Assistanceâ or the âInControl Secureâ function is activated, real-time location data relating to the Vehicle will be sent to the relevant service provider and/or emergency services (as appropriate) even if you have switched off Journeys. Please note that the âInControl Secureâ and the âSOS Emergency Callâ functions will be activated automatically upon the occurrence of a relevant trigger event such as your Vehicle being towed away with the ignition off or the deployment of your vehicleâs airbags respectively. For full details of the relevant trigger events please refer to the Vehicle handbook. By accepting these Terms you consent to the use of the location data in accordance with the Privacy Policy. You have the right to withdraw your consent to us associating location data relating to the Vehicle with personal data that we collect from you at any time by contacting an authorised Land Rover Dealer but please note that this may mean that you will no longer be able to receive the InControl Services.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>5.3Â Â  If you use the InControl Services, you consent to us using data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>6. Â  Your use of the InControl Package</strong>Â </p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (a) promptly set up your InControl Services account using the guidelines available from the Land Rover InControl User Guide. The InControl Services will not be activated until the entire set up process is complete. In addition, for the âLiveâ service to become active you will need to complete the set up process in the Vehicle;</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Â  Â  Â  Â Â  (b) only use the InControl Services for their intended use and in a reasonable manner (for example, the âSOS Emergency Callâ service must only be used for actual emergencies, the âOptimised Land Rover Assistanceâ service must only be used for actual roadside assistance needs and the âInControl Secureâ service must only be used in relation to actual and/or suspected theft of your Vehicle);Â </p>

<p><br/></p>

Neither we nor any of our service providers have any obligation to enquire about the authority of anyone using your Vehicle, password or PINs. You are responsible for the actions related to the InControl Services of every person using your credentials and unless we are at fault, we cannot be held responsible for any unauthorised use of the InControl Services;Â </p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â  (h) ensure that you turn on the âService Modeâ when your Vehicle is being serviced and turn on the âTransport Modeâ when your Vehicle is being transported in order to prevent the theft alert from being activated. This can be done via the InControl Remote Smartphone App or the My Land Rover InControl website;Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â  (i) ensure that you turn on the âValet Modeâ on your Vehicle if you leave it with someone who you do not wish to have access to âLiveâ or WiFi Hotspot on the Vehicle;Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â  (j) be responsible for use of the âremember meâ function that applies to certain features of the InControl Package. This function enables you to remain automatically logged in on the Vehicle for more convenient access to the features. Please be aware that while this function is active any other person using the Vehicle will be able to view your stored settings, features and personal details in the Vehicle and use the InControl Services in the Vehicle as if they were you. You should ensure the âremember meâ function is disabled if you do not wish other Users to have access;Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â  (k) only use the InControl Connectivity Services for utilising and accessing the InControl Services;Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â  (l) inform us or an authorised Land Rover dealer as soon as possible if you become aware of a security breach or any unauthorised use of the InControl Services;Â </p>

<p>Â Â Â Â  (m) be responsible for all Network Provider and data plan charges relating to your Personal SIM and use of âLiveâ and Wi-Fi Hotspot (after any initial free trial period or inclusive data plan where applicable). This includes any Network Provider charges for international data roaming. Please be aware that a small amount of InControl Connectivity Services data will be sent over your Personal SIM when Mobile Data and/or the Wi-Fi Hotspot are enabled.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>6.2Â Â  Some countries may prohibit or restrict the use of certain InControl Services (for example, the remote engine start function). You must make yourself aware of, and you must comply with, all local laws in each country in which you intend to use or are using the InControl Services.Â </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Â  Â  Â  (d) disassemble, decompile, reverse-engineer or create derivative works based on the whole or any part of the InControl Remote Smartphone App, Live Features or the My Land Rover InControl website or attempt to do any such thing except to the extent that (by virtue of section 296A of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988) such actions cannot be prohibited because they are essential for the purpose of achieving inter-operability of the InControl Remote Smartphone App, Live Features or the My Land Rover InControl website with another software program, and provided that the information obtained by you during such activities:Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (i) is used only for the purpose of achieving inter-operability of the InControl Remote Smartphone App, Live Features or the My Land Rover InControl website with another software program;Â </p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
<br/></p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (ii) is not unnecessarily disclosed or communicated without our prior written consent to any third party; andÂ </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (iii) is not used to create any software that is substantially similar to the InControl Remote Smartphone App, Live Features or the My Land Rover InControl website.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (a) in the event that your Vehicle is stolen and you use such service, you must immediately notify the police and obtain a crime reference number;Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (b) you acknowledge that such service is provided to assist you in tracking the location of your Vehicle and does not include or cover the actual recovery of your Vehicle. Accordingly, we cannot be held responsible for any damage incurred to your Vehicle pending or during the recovery of your Vehicle at the specified location;Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (c) we cannot guarantee that by using such service your Vehicle will be found and will not be responsible for the acts or omissions of the stolen vehicle tracking service provider or the police;Â </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (e) you will not be able to obtain the location of your Vehicle from the stolen vehicle tracking service provider.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>8.7Â Â  The InControl Services will be provided to you with reasonable skill and care and we will use reasonable endeavours to provide the InControl Services to you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, however you acknowledge that:Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (a) we cannot guarantee that the InControl Services (or any of their functions) or the My Land Rover InControl website will be error free or will be continuously available. The availability and functionality of any of the InControl Services will be dependent upon network coverage and other factors relating to your Vehicle. For example, the InControl Services may not be available in all areas (for example in remote or enclosed areas) and be affected by obstructions such as hills, tall buildings and tunnels. In addition, 2G and/or 3G mobile signal or GNSS (e.g. GPS) may not always be available and can therefore impact operation and availability of the InControl Services. Please refer to the Vehicleâs handbook for details of some of the factors that will affect the availability and functionality of the InControl Services;Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (b) the InControl Services may not operate if your Vehicle (and the telematics control unit in your Vehicle) has not been maintained and kept in a good working condition;Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (c) the operation of the âSOS Emergency Callâ service, the âOptimised Land Rover Assistanceâ service, and the âInControl Secureâ service is dependent upon the telematics control unit in the Vehicle being fully operational. If, therefore, the telematics control unit is damaged or removed, the InControl Services will not be able to be provided;Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (d) the InControl Services may be subject to periods of disruption and/or downtime during periods of maintenance of and/or modification to the InControl Services (including any telecommunications networks).Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>8.8Â Â Â  If you are a consumer, you have legal rights in relation to services not carried out with reasonable skill and care, or software that is faulty or not as described.

<p><br/></p>
<p>9.2Â Â  Live Feature are either provided by us or by our authorised third party providers. Each Live Feature may be subject to the relevant third party providerâs terms and conditions and privacy policies (which are separate to these Terms). Where applicable, you will need to read and accept them in order to access and use that Live Feature.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>9.3Â Â  We are not responsible for any arrangements or agreements made between you and the third party app providers and they are entered into at your sole risk and expense. For example, you are responsible for payment of any charges for Live Features that you choose to download or subscribe to.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>9.4Â Â  The choice of Live Features available for your InControl Package and Vehicle may be subject to change from time to time. We reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Live Features at any time without notice.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>9.5Â Â  We cannot guarantee the accuracy, quality, performance, availability, completeness, or reliability of any Live Features, nor that they will always be error free, up-to-date, or permitted to use under local laws in all countries.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>16.1 Â Â  If you are a consumer and you have any questions or if you have any complaints, please contact an authorised Land Rover dealer.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>16.2Â Â Â  If you are a consumer and you wish to contact us in writing you can send this to us by hand or by post to an authorised Land Rover dealer who will confirm receipt of this by contacting you in writing. If we have to contact you or give you notice in writing, we will do so by e-mail, by hand, or by post to the address you provided to the authorised Land Rover dealer from whom you purchased your Vehicle.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>16.3Â Â Â Â  If you are a business customer, please note that any notice given by you to us, or by us to you, will be deemed received and properly served immediately when posted on our website, 24 hours after an e-mail is sent, or three days after the date of posting of any letter. In proving the service of any notice, it will be sufficient to prove, in the case of a letter, that such letter was properly addressed, stamped and placed in the post and, in the case of an e-mail, that such e-mail was sent to the specified e-mail address of the addressee.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>17.Â Â Â Â Â  Other important termsÂ </strong></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>17.1Â Â Â  We may transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these Terms.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>17.2Â Â Â  You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these Terms to another person if we agree in writing.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>17.3Â Â Â  The contract for the provision of the InControl Package is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of these Terms except that the Network Operator may enforce clause 14.2 against you.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>17.4Â Â  The following clauses will continue to apply after the End Date or earlier termination: 5, 6, 7, 9, 10.2, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 17 of these Terms.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>17.5Â Â  Each of the clauses in these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining clauses will remain in full force and effect.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>17.6Â Â  If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a breach of these Terms by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later breach by you.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>17.7Â Â  If you are a consumer, please note that this contract between you and us for your use of the InControl Package is governed by English law. This means that any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms will be governed by English law. You and we both agree to that the courts of England and Wales will have non-exclusive jurisdiction. However, if you are a resident of Northern Ireland you may also bring proceedings in Northern Ireland, and if you are a resident of Scotland, you may also bring proceedings in Scotland.Â </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>17.8Â Â  If you are a business customer, these Terms, their subject matter and their formation (and any non-contractual disputes or claims) are governed by English law. We both agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.</p></div>
