				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a year ago we released our last WordPress theme, to research and find the best WordPress solution, and now, we&#8217;re happy to say we&#8217;ve found it and we&#8217;re currently working around the clock to bring you our entire portfolio in WordPress.</p>
<p><span id="more-56051"></span></p>
<h4>The Partnership.</h4>
<p>We&#8217;ve search long and wide for the perfect WordPress developer, with the same love for code, the same love and dedication to customers and the best developer to obtain Themes that are not only easy to use but are written like poetry. Easy to use, fast to load, performance enhanced, and the most important factor, to easily merge with your desktop theme, providing you a richer, better experience for your mobile device. Therefore, we partnered up with Webbu. An absolutely exquisitely Talented Developer, Elite Author and an author that has the same dedication and love towards our buyers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Products.</h4>
<p>As the lead developer of the Mobile Niche on ThemeForest ( yours truly ) the decision to insert a new member was hard, and after seeing the quality code that Webbu can make, we decided to up the game and bring something to the world that was only limited to responsive, sluggish designs. We can&#8217;t help but agree that WordPress Desktop Themes do provide an amazingly beautiful admin panel, but when it came to mobile loading times, performance, design quality, the results we always saw and most likely you always see are horrendous. Therefore, with a vision in mind, Webbu produced the best and most amazing admin panel for a Mobile Theme you&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Features</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s much easier to make a huge list of the things our WordPress Mobile Themes will be capable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Theme Switcher Mode</li>
<li>iOS WebApp</li>
<li>Retina Support</li>
<li>Shortcut Icon</li>
<li>Custom CSS Settings</li>
<li>Load Animations</li>
<li>Load Logos</li>
<li>Loading Text</li>
<li>Background Color</li>
<li>Preload Image</li>
<li>Menu Logo</li>
<li>Menu Measurements Edits</li>
<li>Dual Sidebar Settings</li>
<li>Full Sidebar Customizer</li>
<li>Full Content Customizer</li>
<li>Add To HomeScreen Bubble</li>
<li>A toooone of awesome shortcodes.</li>
<li>Editor in KitchenSink</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, if these settings seem small to you, here&#8217;s a great way to enhance it for you. Every feature we&#8217;ve mentioned above allows absolutely full and complete customization. This will give you the biggest flexibility of any WordPress Mobile Theme you&#8217;ve ever laid your hands on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Performance.</h4>
<p>When we partnered with Webbu our main concern was that WordPress is a heavy platform, and sometimes the performance of many themes is greatly affected due to the tones of features that get added to it, but we&#8217;re pleased to announce, that our products load just as fast as before, meaning, instantly!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The First Item</h4>
<p>Our first item will be released this month, and it will be <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/promobile-mobile-tablet-responsive-template/12328697?ref=Enabled">ProMobile</a>, an absolute best seller and a requested product time and again. The next? We&#8217;ll, it&#8217;s easy to find out! Subscribe below and keep in touch with our products, releases, discounts and more. Also, be sure to give <a href="https://themeforest.net/user/webbu/portfolio">Webbu&#8217;s Portfolio</a> a visit. He&#8217;s Mobile products are few, but when it comes to WordPress, this guy writes poetry!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been an amazing journey, where we learned a lot, and gave all we can to develop a niche that was struggling to compete with other categories. In the past years of development, we&#8217;ve reached out to an amazing 20.000 customers, and became the lead developers of templates and themes in the Mobile Niche! Thank you!</p>
<p>We started out years ago, with an old iPhone 2G annoyed by how slow the connection to the simplest sites was, and with how ugly all pages were. it was annoying to constantly zoom in to see even the biggest text. So we built our first mobile template. It was an instant success and customers were asking us to custom build their pages for them.</p>
<p>While working with our customers we discovered the unharnessed potential of the mobile niche, a niche flooded with frameworks that were simply ugly and failed at copying a constantly evolving native UI. Epsilon was born, our framework which doesn&#8217;t rely on trying to copy iOS or Android or other large platforms, it was purely built from CSS and JS and was made for reusable elements. A copy and paste away from using any element anywhere.</p>
<p>As we evolved, so did Epsilon, slowly becoming the best sold <a href="https://themeforest.net/user/enabled/portfolio?ref=Enabled">Mobile Templates and Themes</a> on <a href="https://themeforest.net/user/enabled/portfolio?ref=Enabled">ThemeForest</a>. It was only natural to expand our view to Tablets and modify the framework to give the power it gives today.</p>
<p>It was at this point we started working with classic, unintrusive HTML, CSS, and JS code, only to discover that by doing so, our items became the perfect candidates for PhoneGap and Cordova. Now, most of our users purchase our items to convert them to applications, and they never have any trouble achieving this due to the simple code we use.</p>
<p>Now, almost 15.000 sales later, Epsilon is fully CSS3 enabled, loading amost as fast as Google AMP ( yes, we have the courage to say that ) with every possible feature you can ever imagine or ever need from a mobile page! And we&#8217;re still growing and growing without affecting it&#8217;s performance yet constantly improving it&#8217;s power!</p>
<p>Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for supporting us, and we will continue to support you around the clock and constantly release awesome new products! Even more powerful, faster, elegant, and with the same user friendly code and impeccable support and documentations!</p>
<p>Our ever growing <a href="https://themeforest.net/user/enabled/portfolio?ref=Enabled">portfolio stands available for you on ThemeForest</a> and our <a href="http://enableds.com/store/">personal store stands available here</a> as well if you wish to see things in an easier to view environment and filter out what you&#8217;re looking for!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
