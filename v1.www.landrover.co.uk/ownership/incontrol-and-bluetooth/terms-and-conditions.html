For full details of the relevant trigger events please refer to the Vehicle handbook. By accepting these terms and conditions you consent to the use of the location data in accordance with the Privacy Policy. You have the right to withdraw your consent to us associating location data relating to the Vehicle with personal data that we collect from you at any time by contacting an authorised Land Rover Dealer but please note that this may mean that you will no longer be able to receive the InControl Services.

Where the Event Outside our Control affects our performance of InControl Services to you, we will restart the InControl Services as soon as reasonably possible after the Event Outside our Control is over.
<br/>
12.4 You may terminate the contract between us if an Event Outside our Control takes place and you no longer wish us to provide the InControl Services.
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>13. Termination or suspension of the InControl Package by us</strong>
<br/>
13.1 In the event that you breach any of these Terms, we shall be entitled to immediately terminate or suspend your use of the InControl Package (or any part thereof) and you will be liable to pay the reasonable costs that we incur as a result of such breach (including any reasonable costs that we may incur in relation to any removal of the hardware that is installed in your Vehicle for the purpose of providing the InControl Services).
<br/>
13.2 If you breach any of the terms and conditions contained in clause 6 above, our Network Provider shall be entitled to immediately suspend the InControl Connectivity Services and you will be liable to pay the reasonable costs that our Network Provider incurs as a result of such breach.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>14. Termination of the InControl Package by you</strong>
<br/>
14.1 Once you have activated the InControl Package, you may only terminate your InControl Services before the End Date if:
<br/>
Â Â Â  (a) we breach these Terms in any material way;
<br/>
Â Â Â  (b) you are a consumer and we go into liquidation or a receiver or an administrator is appointed over our assets;
<br/>
Â Â Â  (c) we change any of these Terms or the InControl Services to your material disadvantage;
<br/>
Â Â Â  (d) we are affected by an Event Outside our Control.
<br/>
14.2 You must remove your Vehicle from your InControl Services account when you sell your Vehicle. The InControl Services with the exception of InControl Secure will be provided to the new owner of your Vehicle for the remainder of the Term subject to the new owner completing the InControl Services account setup.
<br/>
14.3 On termination of your InControl Package:
<br/>
Â Â Â  (a) all rights granted to you under these Terms shall cease;
<br/>
Â Â Â  (b) you must immediately cease all activities authorised by these Terms, including your use of any InControl Services; and
<br/>
Â Â Â  (c) you must immediately delete or remove the InControl Remote Smartphone App from all devices upon which the InControl Remote Smartphone App is installed, and immediately destroy all copies of the InControl Remote Smartphone App then in your possession, custody or control.
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>15. How to contact us</strong>
<br/>
15.1 If you are a consumer and you have any questions or if you have any complaints, please contact an authorised Land Rover dealer.
<br/>
15.2 If you are a consumer and you wish to contact us in writing you can send this to us by hand or by post to an authorised Land Rover dealer who will confirm receipt of this by contacting you in writing. If we have to contact you or give you notice in writing, we will do so by e-mail, by hand, or by post to the address you provided to the authorised Land Rover dealer from whom you purchased your Vehicle.
<br/>
15.3 If you are a business customer, please note that any notice given by you to us, or by us to you, will be deemed received and properly served immediately when posted on our website, 24 hours after an e-mail is sent, or three days after the date of posting of any letter. In proving the service of any notice, it will be sufficient to prove, in the case of a letter, that such letter was properly addressed, stamped and placed in the post and, in the case of an e-mail that such e-mail was sent to the specified e-mail address of the addressee.
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>16. Other important terms</strong>
<br/>
16.1 We may transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these Terms.
<br/>
16.2 You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these Terms to another person if we agree in writing.
<br/>
16.3 The contract for the provision of the InControl Package is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of these Terms except that the Network Operator may enforce the terms and conditions of clause 6 and clause 13 against you in the event that you breach any of those terms and conditions.
<br/>
16.4 The following clauses will continue to apply after termination of the Package: 5, 7, 9.2, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 16 of these Terms.
<br/>
16.5 Each of the clauses in these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining clauses will remain in full force and effect.
<br/>
16.6 If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.
<br/>
16.7 If you are a consumer, please note that the contract between you and us for your use of the InControl Package is governed by English law. This means that any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it will be governed by English law. You and we both agree to that the courts of England and Wales will have non-exclusive jurisdiction. However, if you are a resident of Northern Ireland you may also bring proceedings in Northern Ireland, and if you are a resident of Scotland, you may also bring proceedings in Scotland.
<br/>
16.8 If you are a business customer, this licence, its subject matter and its formation (and any non-contractual disputes or claims) are governed by English law. We both agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.</p></div>
